# COVID-19 Vaccine Finder Tools

This is a list of community projects designed to help people find available COVID-19 vaccines and get appointments. Because vaccination is handled differently and implemented by different organizations across the U.S., it can be hard for people get a clear sense of where they can get vaccinated and where to sign up; these projects aim to fill that gap.

Our goals here are to:

1. Help people find good tools to get appointments.

2. Get technologists working together and collaborating on these tools (or just sharing patterns) where possible. Ideally we can have as few tools in any given geographic area as possible to reduce load on official services.

3. Identify common patterns or needs we can encourage public health officials and government technologists to support. Could their sites take cues from community projects? Could they implement markup patterns on pages or simple APIs that reduce their servers’ load and make their data easier to scrape or parse?

## General Projects

**[COVID-19 Vaccine Tracker](https://github.com/jwoglom/covid19-vaccine-tracker)** is a self-hosted, configurable system for sending notifications when there are vaccine sign-up slots available. It contains several backends which get data from public vaccination sign-up websites, primarily in the Massachusetts area, but is also extensible and can be configured to scrape any website.
- Data Source: Scraping (currently supports Curative, RxTouch, CVS Pharmacy, and MAImmunizations websites)
- Developed By: [James Woglom](https://github.com/jwoglom)
- Source Repo: https://github.com/jwoglom/covid19-vaccine-tracker

**[VacFind](https://vacfind.org)** is working to create an open, nationwide database of COVID-19 Vaccine availability data, build an open-source user-friendly portal to allow easy access, and bring together a community of developers working on COVID response projects to facilitate resource sharing and improve efficiency and project re-use.
- Data Sources: scraping, aggregating already-scraped results from other sites, [GISCorps vaccination site data](https://covid-19-giscorps.hub.arcgis.com/) from [https://findcovidtesting.com/](https://findcovidtesting.com/).
